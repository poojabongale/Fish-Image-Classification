# Fish-Image-Classification Using CNN and Transfer Learning
A machine learning project that helps in classifying fish into various classes that they belong to. Built a custom CNN and trained models that will help in predicting the fish class.
This project classifies fish species from images using deep learning models such as CNN (trained from scratch) and pre-trained models like ResNet50, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, VGG16, and EfficientNetB0. 
A Streamlit web app allows users to upload fish images and get predictions with confidence scores.
Features of this project:
1.Upload fish images via a clean Streamlit UI
2.Predict fish category using a trained .h5 model
3.Display top predicted class with confidence
4.Show confidence scores for all classes
5.Support for models trained from scratch or using transfer learning
